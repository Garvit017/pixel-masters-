## API Configuration

### Using Real Weather Data
To use real weather data instead of mock data:

1. **Get API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. **Update Configuration**: Edit `src/services/weatherApi.ts`
3. **Replace API Key**: Change `const API_KEY = 'demo_key';` to your actual key
4. **Uncomment API Calls**: Remove the mock data fallbacks in the store

### API Endpoints Used
- **Current Weather**: `/weather` - Current weather conditions
- **5-Day Forecast**: `/forecast` - Weather predictions
- **Geocoding**: `/direct` - Location search
- **Reverse Geocoding**: `/reverse` - Coordinates to location

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port already in use**: If port 3002 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port
2. **Dependencies not installing**: Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. **TypeScript errors**: Make sure all dependencies are properly installed
4. **Map not loading**: Check if Leaflet CSS is properly loaded in index.html
5. **Location not working**: Ensure HTTPS or localhost for geolocation API

### Development Tips
- Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the development server
- The app supports hot reloading - changes will appear automatically
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Use React Developer Tools for debugging
- All data is stored in localStorage and persists across sessions

## Production Build
To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` folder and can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Notes
- The app uses Zustand for efficient state management
- Local storage provides fast data persistence
- Optimistic updates give immediate feedback
- Responsive design ensures smooth mobile experience
- Maps are lazy-loaded for better performance

## Security Notes
- No user data is collected or transmitted
- All data is stored locally in the browser
- API keys should be kept secure (use environment variables in production)
- Location data is only used for weather information
